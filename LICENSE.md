## About the Open Government Licence

This licence enables Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common open licence. Public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database right are invited to permit the use of their Information under this licence.

This is version 1.0 of the Open Government Licence. New versions of the Open Government Licence may be issued from time to time. If you are already using Information under a previous version of the Open Government Licence, the terms of that licence will continue to apply.

These terms are compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 and the Open Data Commons Attribution License, both of which license copyright and database right. This means that when the Information is adapted and licensed under either of those licences, you automatically satisfy the conditions of the OGL when you comply with the other licence. The OGLv3.0 is Open Definition compliant.
